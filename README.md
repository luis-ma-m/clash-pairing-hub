## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git for version control

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd debateministrator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This installs **all** required packages, including development
   dependencies. A full install is necessary before running `npm run lint`
   or any TypeScript build scripts.

### Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

  After copying, **edit `.env` and fill in `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`,
  `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`**. These correspond to lines
  5‚Äì8 in `.env.example` and are required for the Supabase client to work.

2. Edit `.env` to configure the Supabase credentials.

   Create a project at [Supabase](https://supabase.com), then copy the **Project URL** and **Anon public key** from the dashboard. Add them to `.env`:

   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=https://avzduledlmahtvmvgnxy.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImF2emR1bGVkbG1haHR2bXZnbnh5Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDk2Njk5ODYsImV4cCI6MjA2NTI0NTk4Nn0.Ni6j-h6oNcDrC8ppCjBZmzciAZhQx8An_GN-o62Jatk
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://avzduledlmahtvmvgnxy.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImF2emR1bGVkbG1haHR2bXZnbnh5Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDk2Njk5ODYsImV4cCI6MjA2NTI0NTk4Nn0.Ni6j-h6oNcDrC8ppCjBZmzciAZhQx8An_GN-o62Jatk
   ```

   The Vite variables are used on the client and should match the server values.

### Supabase Setup

1. Sign in to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and create a new project.
2. In your project's **Settings ‚Üí API** section copy the **Project URL** and **Anon public key**.
3. Paste those values into the corresponding variables in your `.env` file as shown above.
4. These variables must be present when building the frontend. They will **not** be injected into the browser unless the same values are duplicated using the `VITE_` prefix.
5. See [docs/credentials.md](docs/credentials.md) for the default admin login and a list of required environment variables. These must be configured before running `npm run create-admin`.
6. The login and signup pages require `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to be set in `.env`. If either variable is missing or contains placeholder text, the app displays a ‚ÄúSetup Required‚Äù screen (the `AuthFallback` component) instead of the forms.
7. When deploying to platforms like **Vercel** or **Netlify**, add these environment variables in the platform dashboard and redeploy the application so the build picks them up.

### Creating the Admin User

After configuring `.env`, you can create the default admin account by running:

```bash
npm run create-admin
```

This script uses the credentials described in [docs/credentials.md](docs/credentials.md). Provide `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` if possible; otherwise it will fall back to the anon key.

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to see the application.

### Development Commands

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `npm run dev` | Start development server |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run linting *(assumes dependencies installed)* |

### Running Tests

Install dependencies if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install
```

Alternatively you can use **Bun**:

```bash
bun install
```

Then execute all unit tests:

```bash
npm test --silent
```

This command runs all unit tests including Swiss pairing and bracket generation checks.

For tests that need Supabase, import `test/localStorageSupabase.ts` to use a
localStorage-backed mock. Call `setMockData()` before each test to seed the
tables your test expects.

## üéØ Success Criteria

The platform aims to enable tournament administrators to:
- Import teams and participants effortlessly
- Run complete Swiss-system tournaments (4+ rounds)
- Generate elimination brackets automatically
- Input and track scores in real-time
- Monitor tournament progress through live dashboards
- Handle a 16-team tournament with 3 judges per debate without manual intervention

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Backend
- Database schema implementation
- Authentication system
- Basic API endpoints
- Data validation and security

### Phase 2: Core Tournament Management (Weeks 4-6)
- Tournament creation with format selection
- Team and speaker management linked to tournaments
- Round tracking with progression logic
- Tournament status and settings management

#### Usage
The **All Tournaments** section of the dashboard lists every event in the
database. Edit the status field or change settings like `rounds` and
`elimination` type directly in the list and click **Save**. This issues a
`PUT /api/tournaments/:id` request so the updates persist in Supabase.

### Phase 3: Real-time Features
- WebSocket integration
- Live score updates
- Real-time bracket progression
- Push notifications

### Phase 4: Advanced Analytics
- Performance metrics
- Predictive analytics
- Export capabilities
- Data visualization enhancements

### Phase 5: Mobile Optimization
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Offline capability
- Mobile-specific UI improvements
- Push notification support
