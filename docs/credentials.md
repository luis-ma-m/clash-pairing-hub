# Admin Credentials and Local Storage

The default admin account uses the following credentials:

- **Email:** `admin@luis.martin`
- **Password:** `sa1965`

During development these values are written to the browser's `localStorage` the
first time the app runs. Logging in with them works immediately without any
external setup. Clearing your browser storage removes the account and resets the
application to its initial state.
